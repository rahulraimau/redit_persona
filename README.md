Reddit Persona Scraper

Overview
The Reddit Persona Scraper is a Python script that builds a user persona by scraping a Reddit user's posts and comments using the Reddit API (via PRAW). It analyzes the content to infer characteristics such as interests, personality traits, expertise level, demographics, and engagement style, and outputs the persona to a text file with citations to specific posts or comments.
This tool is useful for researchers, marketers, or anyone interested in understanding a Reddit user's online behavior based on their public activity.
Features

Input: Accepts a Reddit user profile URL (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/).
Data Scraping: Retrieves up to 50 recent posts and comments using the Reddit API.
Persona Generation: Infers user characteristics based on subreddit activity, sentiment analysis, and content complexity.
Output: Saves the persona to a text file (<username>_persona.txt) with citations to source posts/comments.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid usernames, API errors, or unavailable data.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Reddit API Credentials: Obtain client_id, client_secret, and user_agent from Reddit Apps.
Dependencies:
praw (Reddit API wrapper)
textblob (sentiment analysis)
pandas (data handling)



Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/rahulraimau/reddit-persona-scraper.git
cd reddit-persona-scraper


Install Dependencies:
pip install praw textblob pandas


Set Up Reddit API Credentials:

Create a Reddit app at Reddit Apps.
Copy the client_id (under the app name) and client_secret.
Edit reddit_persona_scraper.py and update the following:reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    user_agent="Reddit Persona Scraper by /u/your_username"
)

Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET, and your_username with your credentials.



Usage

Run the Script:
python reddit_persona_scraper.py


Enter a Reddit User Profile URL:When prompted, input a valid Reddit user profile URL (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/).

Output:

The script creates a reddit_personas directory in the project folder.
A text file named <username>_persona.txt is generated, containing the user persona with citations.

Notes

API Limits: The script retrieves up to 50 posts and 50 comments to stay within Reddit API rate limits. Modify the limit parameter in scrape_user_data (e.g., limit=None) for more data, but use cautiously to avoid rate limiting.
Privacy and Compliance: Ensure adherence to Reddit's API terms and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when using this script.
Analysis: Uses TextBlob for basic sentiment analysis. For more advanced analysis, consider libraries like VADER or spaCy.
Error Handling: The script handles cases like invalid usernames or API errors. Verify credentials if issues occur.

Troubleshooting

SyntaxError: Ensure Python 3.8+ is used and check for hidden characters in the code (use editors like VS Code).
API Errors: Confirm Reddit API credentials and internet connectivity.
No Data Retrieved: The user may have a private/suspended account or no public activity.
Missing Libraries: Verify that praw, textblob, and pandas are installed.
